    "While word frequencies, by themselves, do not give us a tremendous amount of contextual information, they are a valuable first step in conducting large scale text analyses. For instance, returning to our frequency list for <code>privacy</code>, we can observe a general trend suggesting that the use of <code>privacy</code> has been increasing between 2006 and now. It is important to note that our calculations are a raw number. For a more contextual analysis we could calculate how many times the Parliament was in session during each period, or perhaps we could compare the word <code>privacy</code> to the total amount of words in each file.</p>\n",
